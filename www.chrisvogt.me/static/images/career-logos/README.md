# Career curve logos

Drop company logo images here to show them in the career path curve avatars on the About page.

- **Location:** Files in this folder are served at `/images/career-logos/` (e.g. `godaddy.png` → `/images/career-logos/godaddy.png`).
- **Wiring:** In `components/CareerPathCurve.js`, add an entry to the `CAREER_LOGOS` object mapping the **exact** company name to the path, e.g. `'GoDaddy': '/images/career-logos/godaddy.png'`.
- **Company name keys** (from career-path.json):  
  `GoDaddy`, `OfficeMax Print & Document Services`, `FedEx Kinko's`, `Robert Half & TEKsystems`, `Apogee Physicians`, `Encore Discovery Solutions`, `Pan Am Education`, `Salucro Healthcare Solutions`, `Art In Reality, LLC`
- **Formats:** PNG, SVG, or WebP work well. Keep files small (e.g. 64×64 or 128×128) for fast loading.
