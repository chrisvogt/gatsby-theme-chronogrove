This is my fourth monthly recap, a monthly writing ritual I started June 2025 where I recap the month work in a topic-organized journal entry. When these articles are published, they can be accessed on my [Now](/now) page. When the next recap publishes, I move the previous post into the blog to archive it.

## üöó Road Trip to Sonoma County

I took a weekend road trip up to Sonoma County to spend Labor Day weekend in Guerneville, a small town on the Russian River, around 1.5 to 2 hours drive north of San Francisco, that gathers a lot of LGBTQ+ travelers in the summer. The high temperature hit the mid 90s F while I was there, making it a perfect time to hang out at the pool.

While I was there, I also visited the nearby town of Healdsburg and did a wine tasting at Rodney Strong and a glass of wine at La Crema wineries.

Finally, on the way home, I drove down Highway 1 and stopped at a few places down the coast to take photos and look for souvenirs.

## üéµ Building My Vinyl Collection

My vinyl collection continued to grow in September and I'm now at 63 LPs. Early in the month I found a new vinyl store called The Plastic Pancake on Valencia in the Mission, across from Clooney's, and they have a wide selection of used vinyls that are priced well. All of the classic vinyls I added this month came from there.

Here are the new vinyls I added to my collection this month:

## üå± Indoor Gardening

I've gotten really into indoor gardening this month! I now have three countertop Aerogardens running indoors, plus a large floor Aerogarden where I'm growing cucumbers, jalape√±os, and cherry tomatoes. The cucumber plant has been growing incredibly fast and keeps reaching out to stretch its growth like a vine‚Äîit's fascinating to watch how it adapts and grows toward the light.

## ü¶Å Visiting San Diego and the San Diego Zoo

I took a trip down to San Diego and spent a day at the world-famous San Diego Zoo. It was an incredible experience seeing all the different animals up close. I captured photos of bears, snakes, elephants, and lemurs, among many others. The zoo does such an amazing job creating naturalistic habitats for the animals.

The lemurs were particularly entertaining to watch‚Äîthey were so active and playful. The elephants were majestic, and I spent a long time just observing their behavior. It was a great reminder of the incredible diversity of life on our planet.

## üë• Out with Friends

September brought some great highlights with friends. Whether it was exploring new restaurants, going to events, or just hanging out, I've been grateful for the time spent with the people who matter most to me. These moments of connection and shared experiences are what make life rich and meaningful.

## üíº Work

Work has been mostly focused on building agentic systems and agents that help customers manage their business. It's been exciting to work on AI-powered solutions that can actually make a meaningful difference for our users. The technology is advancing so quickly, and it's rewarding to be part of building these systems.

I'm also on a core team contributing a new perpetual Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) experiment type to the company's experimentation platform. This has involved making UI updates to the platform and creating reports and visualizations for experimentation review. It's been a great opportunity to work on both the technical implementation and the user experience aspects of the feature.

## üìö What I'm Reading

I finished reading _Finding My Humanity_ by Ryan Ubuntu Olson this month. I really enjoyed reading his coming of age story‚Äîit was a powerful and moving memoir that explored themes of identity, community, and finding one's place in the world. The book resonated with me on several levels, and I found myself reflecting on my own journey and the people who have shaped who I am.

There's a particular line from the book that really stuck with me, and I'll be using it as the closing quote for this blog post. Sometimes a single sentence can capture so much truth about the human experience.

> "We are all connected in ways we cannot always see, but that connection is what makes us human."
