This is my second monthly recap, a monthly writing ritual I started June 2025 where I recap the month work in a topic-organized journal entry. When these articles are published, they can be accessed on my [Now](/now) page. When the next recap publishes, I move the previous post into the blog to archive it.

## ðŸŽ¯ July Overview

July started out with a short trip to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico over the 4th of July weekend. I've also been adding new features to my personal website, practicing new songs on the piano, collecting LPs on vinyl, and practicing new songs. At the end of the month, I worked out of Tempe, Arizona for a week, where I stopped by to visit my parents, who live in Arizona. I'll cover that all and more in this article.

## Updates to My Website

I added a few new features to my personal website this month: a new UI for my Steam game play widget and a Discogs widget, both on the [Home](/) page, and an interactive career visualization on my [About](/about) page.

I've also been working to make the theme for my site reusable, so others can use it for their own sites.

## What I'm Working On At Work

Continuing with the theme of last month, AI is still a big focus at work. Both as a product feature and as a way to improve productivity and the quality of our code.

## ðŸŒ´ Puerto Vallarta, Mexico

In 2021 I met Francis while docked in CuraÃ§ao on a Celebrity Cruise ship. We've kept in touch over the years and met up last year in NYC. A couple months before July he invited me to join him and a friend for their first visit to Puerto Vallarta.

I already had 2 days off work for the 4th of July holiday, and learned a friend and former coworker was also going to be in town with his partner, and so I took an extra day off work and flew down for a Wednesday-Sunday trip.

My United flight from SFO to PVR was fastâ€”only 3 hours, 45 minutes. I recommend sitting on the left side of the plane for the best views, because you'll face inland and see the mountains.

I stayed at an LGBTQ resort in Amapas, a neighborhood (colonia) just south of the Romantic Zone (Zona RomÃ¡ntica) and Playa de los Muertos. It's a 10-minute walk to the beach and slightly uphill, making it a good spot to look out over the bay and stay a close walk to the action while having a quiet, private space to relax.

Here are a few of the photos I took around the area while I was there.

## Collecting Vinyls

Vinyl has taken over my friend group â€” my friends are constantly talking about new records they're litening to, and I've caught the bug too. I've built up a collection of 37 LPs so far and finally bought a record player, an [AT-LP120XBT-USB-BK](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/at-lp120xbt-usb).

I've been using [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) to track my collection, which is now rendered on a new widget on the Home page. It uses the Discogs API to fetch and render an up-to-date list of my LPs.

## What I'm reading

At the beginning of the month I finished _Flowers for Algernon_ by Daniel Keyes. I maintain a list of books that have been recommended by friends when asked for recommendations on what books left a profound impact and stuck with them over the years. My partner recommend this one, and said for them it was a required high school reading assignment.

In Mexico, someone had left a few copies of _Finding My Humanity: I Am Because You Are_ by Ryan Ubuntu Wilson in my hotel room. I took home one of those copies and am now nearly finished reading Ryan's memoir, sharing story as a gay man coming of age in a rural, conservative commmunity in Colorado, and later a private Jesuit institution in Spokane, Washington.
