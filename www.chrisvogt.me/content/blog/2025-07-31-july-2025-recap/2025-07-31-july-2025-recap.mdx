This is my second monthly recap, a monthly writing ritual I started June 2025 where I recap the month work in a topic-organized journal entry. When these articles are published, they can be accessed on my [Now](/now) page. When the next recap publishes, I move the previous post into the blog to archive it.

## ✨ Updates to My Website

I added a few new features to my personal website this month: a new UI for my Steam game play widget and a Discogs widget, both on the [Home](/) page, and an interactive career visualization on my [About](/about) page.

I've also been working to make the theme for my site reusable, so others can use it for their own sites.

## 💼 What I'm Working On at Work

Continuing with the theme of last month, AI is still a big focus at work. Both as a product feature and as a way to improve productivity and the quality of our code.

## 🌴 Puerto Vallarta, Mexico

In 2021 I met Francis while docked in Curaçao on a Celebrity Cruise ship. We've kept in touch over the years and met up last year in NYC. A couple months before July he invited me to join him and a friend for their first visit to Puerto Vallarta.

I already had 2 days off work for the 4th of July holiday, and learned a friend and former coworker was also going to be in town with his partner, and so I took an extra day off work and flew down for a Wednesday-Sunday trip.

My United flight from SFO to PVR was fast—only 3 hours, 45 minutes. I recommend sitting on the left side of the plane for the best views, because you'll face inland and see the mountains.

I stayed at an LGBTQ resort in Amapas, a neighborhood (colonia) just south of the Romantic Zone (Zona Romántica) and Playa de los Muertos. It's a 10-minute walk to the beach and slightly uphill, making it a good spot to look out over the bay and stay a close walk to the action while having a quiet, private space to relax.

Here are a few of the photos I took around the area while I was there.

## 🎵 Collecting Vinyl

Vinyl has taken over my friend group — my friends are constantly talking about new records they're litening to, and I've caught the bug too. I've built up a collection of 37 LPs so far and finally bought a record player, an [AT-LP120XBT-USB-BK](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/at-lp120xbt-usb).

I've been using [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) to track my collection, which is now rendered on a new widget on the Home page. It uses the Discogs API to fetch and render an up-to-date list of my LPs.

## 📚 What I'm Reading

At the beginning of the month I finished _Flowers for Algernon_ by Daniel Keyes. I maintain a list of books that have been recommended by friends when asked for recommendations on what books left a profound impact and stuck with them over the years. My partner recommend this one, and said for them it was a required high school reading assignment.

In Mexico, someone had left a few copies of _Finding My Humanity: I Am Because You Are_ by Ryan Ubuntu Wilson in my hotel room. I took home one of those copies and am now nearly finished reading Ryan's memoir, sharing story as a gay man coming of age in a rural, conservative commmunity in Colorado, and later a private Jesuit institution in Spokane, Washington.
