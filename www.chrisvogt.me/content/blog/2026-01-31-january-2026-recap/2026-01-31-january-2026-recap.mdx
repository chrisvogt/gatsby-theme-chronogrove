Happy new year! January 2026 had me bouncing between San Francisco, Palm Springs, and Phoenix.

## 🌉 San Francisco

### Chinatown

We took the T through the Central Subway to Chinatown early in the month. Walked through Ross Alley, got free samples at the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory, and had deep fried lobster balls at New Love Tea. Nick posed with his zodiac signs along the way.

### Friends

Songhan visited from NYC and we met up with him, Alan, and Iván at The Mix. Sean and Roc joined us at Vesuvio in North Beach. Salim hosted a belated NYE party at his place in the Castro with a backyard patio hangout.

### Out and About

Some city moments: the paperclip resistance at Vesuvio, the Tony Nik's banner in North Beach, the J train in Noe Valley, Trinity Presbyterian Church in the Mission, and a 2026 Bingo Card poster that was very SF.

## 🌴 Palm Springs

On January 15th we flew to Palm Springs for MLK weekend. First time I'd ever been. Our tiny Embraer 175 looked comical next to an Emirates A380 at SFO.

We landed in time for VillageFest, a Thursday night street festival downtown. Checked out Chill Bar, saw Mount San Jacinto from Warm Sands, and spotted a rainbow police cruiser.

### Food

We ate at Casa Blanca Restaurant—guacamole and what can only be described as "heart attack on a plate." Next morning we did brunch at Farm. Nick found a sparrow. We had eggs Benedict and a duck omelette.

## 🌵 Phoenix

Instead of flying home, I rented a car and drove to Phoenix. Spent a week working from the Tempe office and visiting my parents.

### The Drive

Stopped at the General Patton Memorial Museum to see the tanks. In Quartzite I found a "jerky mine" with the best peppered beef brisket jerky I've ever had.

### GoDaddy Tempe

I worked from the GoDaddy office on Mill Ave for a week. Nice views over the Salt River.

### Lindi's Horse Ranch

We visited Lindi's horse ranch in North Scottsdale. Nick spent most of the time with the dogs and a very energetic puppy. Aiden brought in the horses and I got to meet Fletcher up close. Matt showed up later and was immediately pulled around by the puppy.

Lindi also showed us her quilting project.

And that's a brief, photo-heavy recap of my month.
