Happy New Year! 🎉 January 2026 has been a month of reconnections, new explorations, and quality time with family. Here's a look at what I've been up to.

## 🎊 Happy New Year!

{/* TODO: Add your New Year's reflections and celebrations here */}

## 🌉 San Francisco Adventures

January started with a series of wonderful reunions in San Francisco. I had the chance to explore the city with friends we originally met while traveling abroad, as well as host friends who were visiting from out of town.

## 🌴 Palm Springs (MLK Weekend)

On January 15th, we flew to Palm Springs for the MLK weekend — my first time ever visiting or seeing Palm Springs! The desert landscape was stunning, and the food scene didn't disappoint.

## 🌵 Phoenix Road Trip

Instead of flying home from Palm Springs, I rented a car and drove to Phoenix. There, I worked out of the Tempe, AZ office for a week while visiting my parents, who live in the Phoenix and Scottsdale area.

### Driving to Phoenix

On the drive from Palm Springs to Phoenix, I stopped at the General Patton Memorial Museum and passed through Quartzite.

### GoDaddy Tempe Office

I spent a week working out of the GoDaddy office on Mill Ave in Tempe.

### Lindi's Horse Ranch

The highlight of the Phoenix portion of the trip was visiting my friend's horse ranch in North Scottsdale — Lindi's horse ranch.
