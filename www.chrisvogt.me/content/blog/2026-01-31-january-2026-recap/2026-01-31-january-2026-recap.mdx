Happy New Year! 🎉 January 2026 kicked off with reconnections, new explorations, and quality time with family. This month took me from San Francisco to Palm Springs to Phoenix—a journey filled with friends old and new.

## 🌉 San Francisco

### Exploring Chinatown

Early in the month, we took the T through the Central Subway to Chinatown. We wandered through Ross Alley, grabbed free samples at the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory, and stopped for deep fried lobster balls at New Love Tea. Nick posed with his zodiac signs—the rooster and the dragon—along the way.

### Out with Friends

January brought several reunions. Sean and Roc joined us at Vesuvio Cafe in North Beach. Songhan visited from NYC and made a grand entrance—we caught up with him and Iván at The Mix. Later in the month, Salim hosted a belated New Year's Eve party at his place in the Castro, complete with a backyard patio gathering.

### Out and About

Between meetups, I found myself noticing the city's details: the paperclip resistance movement posted at Vesuvio, the Tony Nik's banner in North Beach, the J train rolling through Noe Valley, and a very SF 2026 Bingo Card poster in the Mission. Trinity Presbyterian Church's Romanesque architecture caught my eye while walking through the neighborhood.

## 🌴 Palm Springs

On January 15th, we flew to Palm Springs for MLK weekend—my first time ever visiting. We boarded a tiny Embraer 175 at SFO, dwarfed by an Emirates A380 parked nearby, and landed in the desert an hour later.

We arrived just in time for VillageFest, a Thursday night street festival in downtown Palm Springs. The disco man sculpture at Chill Bar set the tone for the weekend. Mount San Jacinto provided a stunning backdrop from the Warm Sands neighborhood, and I spotted a rainbow police cruiser—very Palm Springs.

### Palm Springs Food

The food scene delivered. We had guacamole and what I can only describe as "heart attack on a plate" at Casa Blanca Restaurant. The next morning, we brunched at Farm, where Nick befriended a sparrow while we enjoyed eggs Benedict and a duck omelette.

## 🌵 Phoenix Road Trip

Instead of flying home, I rented a car and drove to Phoenix to visit my parents and work from the Tempe office for a week.

### The Drive

The drive east on I-10 took me past the General Patton Memorial Museum, where I stopped to photograph the tanks on display. In Quartzite, I discovered a "jerky mine" selling what might be the best peppered beef brisket jerky I've ever had.

### GoDaddy Tempe

I spent the week working from the GoDaddy office on Mill Ave in Tempe. The views over the Salt River were a nice change from my usual home office setup.

### Lindi's Horse Ranch

The highlight of the Phoenix trip was visiting Lindi's horse ranch in North Scottsdale. Nick immediately bonded with the dogs and spent much of the visit keeping watch over an energetic puppy. Aiden brought in the horses, and I got up close with Fletcher. Matt arrived later and was promptly pulled around by the puppy.

Inside, Lindi showed us her latest quilting project—watching the making of a quilt was unexpectedly fascinating. The fridge art added a personal touch to an already warm visit.

## 👋 Wrapping Up

January 2026 was a month of movement—across the city, across the state, and across the desert. From Chinatown dim sum to Palm Springs brunches to horses in Scottsdale, it was filled with the kind of moments that make the start of a new year feel promising. Here's to February.
