Back on August 2nd, I was visiting Tempe, Arizona and met up with Trevor Clay, a talented singer who lives in Phoenix. We spent some time together practicing and testing out a few songs from my repertoire at [repertoire.chrisvogt.me](https://repertoire.chrisvogt.me).

This recording of "Lullaby of Birdland" came out of that session. Fair warning—we didn't have a microphone set up, so the sound quality isn't the best. But I wanted to share it anyway because it was a fun collaboration and a good test run of working together.

We're planning to meet up again in December and do another session, this time with proper recording equipment. Looking forward to seeing how things sound with a microphone and a bit more planning.

Thanks for listening, and thanks to Trevor for taking the time to practice with me!
